# Ryouiki_tenkai

"Ryouiki_tenkai" is a Simulator of Ryouiki-Tenkai with Teachable Machine.

## Usage
  1. Click on [this](https://koyanagit.github.io/Ryouiki_tenkai/).
  2. Concentrate
  3. Complete the hand sign
  4. shout
  5. Concentrate again
  6. you'll be a Shaman

## Note

* This simulations work on only "Google Chrome".
* And, I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.
* Please give this app permission to use camera and mic.

## DEMO

You can learn how to making cute physics simulations (looks retro game).

This animation is a "Cat playing on trampoline"!
You can get basic skills for making physics simulations.

## Features

Physics_Sim_Py used [pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) only.

```python
import pyxel
```
[Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel) is a retro game engine for Python.
You can feel free to enjoy making pixel art style physics simulations.

## Requirement

* Python 3.6.5
* pyxel 1.0.2

Environments under [Anaconda for Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) is tested.

```bash
conda create -n pyxel pip python=3.6 Anaconda
activate pyxel
```

# Installation

Install Pyxel with pip command.

```bash
pip install pyxel
```

## Usage

Please create python code named "demo.py".
And copy &amp; paste [Day4 tutorial code](https://cpp-learning.com/pyxel_physical_sim4/).

Run "demo.py"

```bash
python demo.py
```

## Note

I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.

## In conclusion

"Ryouiki_tenkai" is using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

You can also make app easely such as Ryouiki-Tenkai simulations to use this.

Have a try!

Thank you!
